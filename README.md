To run image server, first open `ustreamer` directory and run `cargo run` in terminal. \
Then run the web server by navigating to `server` in a seperate terminal and run `cargo run`.

This is a work in progress, so many errors may occur. \
Currently, the configuration is hardwired for Rockchip devices. 

Tested on:
* RK3588, Armbian 25.5.2 noble
